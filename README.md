## 📘 Overview
This repository showcases an **end-to-end machine learning pipeline** built using **TensorFlow, Keras, and Scikit-learn**.  
The notebook walks through every stage of an ML workflow — from **data preprocessing** to **model evaluation** — and serves as a learning-friendly, production-ready template for similar projects.

✨ **What makes this project stand out?**
- Well-structured ML workflow
- Clean code with modular sections
- Easily extensible for other datasets or problem statements

---

## 🔍 Key Features
✅ **Data Preprocessing** – handles missing values, scaling, and feature engineering  
✅ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – visualizations and statistical insights  
✅ **Model Building** – implements TensorFlow/Keras deep learning models and Scikit-learn algorithms  
✅ **Model Evaluation** – compares performance with accuracy, loss, and relevant metrics  
✅ **Future-Ready** – can be expanded for deployment (e.g., Streamlit/Flask API)
